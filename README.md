Learning more about Javascript and added skill codes

I used the freeCodeCamp tutorial to learn how to build a blackjack game and re did it this time with some new acquired skills. In here you will find
the new uploads and a sheet that i used to go over the needed skills such as: for loops, different operators, booleans and if else statements.
